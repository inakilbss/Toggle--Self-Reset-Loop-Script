Toggle Self-Reset Loop Script INSTRUCTION MANUAL


Step 1) Replace all the “key” placeholders with the key you want to use.
        Go to https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scripting#List_of_key_names for key names

Step 2) Replace: "action" = Looping action (Remember to use the wait command)
                 "action1" = Extra action when starting the loop.
                 "action2" = Extra action when stopping the loop.
                 If either action2 or action3 aren't used, delete them.
                 You can rename "loop" and "loopstop"; but if you do, rename their other instances respectively.
                 If you rename the script itself, rename the argument on the exec command accordingly.

Step 3) Place the script on: Windows: <Steam Folder>/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg
                             Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg
                             Linux: ~/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg

Step 4) Enjoy!
